# Introduction

Assume that you are tasked to create a checkout flow for an online retail store and you are given the following code as a starting point for the store:

const cart = [{ sku: 38094374, unitPrice: 24.0, name: "Red Shirt", quantity: 2 }, { sku: 38094375, unitPrice: 24.0, name: "Blue Shirt", quantity: 1 }, { sku: 38094321, unitPrice: 12.0, name: "Blue socks", quantity: 4 }]

Using react and react router, create a SPA that routes between three components: Review Cart, Billing/Shipping Information, Order Complete.
Application should use state to pass data between views and components. Use of react hooks is highly recommended.
Choose a style framework (e.g Bootstrap) and add responsive styles to the react application to match the included designs (1 - Review Cart.png, 2 - Check Out.png, and 3 - Order complete.png). Image and icon assets are included in the Assets folder, and the typeface used is Helvetica.
Update the project README.md with instructions on how to install and run your app.
Please do not spend more than 3 hours on this exercise, we are looking on how you approach the problem and how all the pieces fit in your solution. Feel free to provide comments explaining trade-offs you had to make, as well as code pieces that you didn’t have the time to implement.

## Submitting

Each one of the previous 3 steps should be submitted as a pull request in your private GitHub repository of your preference. Please invite assemble-engineering to the repository when you are done and send an email to techscreen@assembleinc.com with a link to your repo, and any additional comments you want to provide.

## Bonuses

Write the application in typescript.
Demonstrate state management using context.
Update and display the quantity of items in the cart
Implement the styling using styled-components or emotion.js.
Provide a diagram of your model.

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
